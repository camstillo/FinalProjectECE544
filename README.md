ECE544 - Final Project

Deepthi, Kim, & Cameron


This project involves the creation of an embedded FPGA watering and plant monitoring system. Using moisture sensors, the moisture levels of the soil is maintained at a constant level with a water pump. The project may invove user control in the form of a GUI. 

To maintain proper version control, we will create a central project folder which contains the block design/rtl in vivado. Once the design is finalized, multiple users can branch off their own code using the same hardware file. Code can then be merged into a trunk folder which will contain all the integrated code. Using this method will minimize differences between code and integration issues.
